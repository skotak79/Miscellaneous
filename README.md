## Kiedy wyw√≥z (iOS)

[www.kiedywywoz.pl](https://www.kiedywywoz.pl)

I tried to more or less copy the home screen, the list of waste collections and the side menu.<br> 
Fun fact - collection dates for the given address are generated programmatically and based on the actual dates.<br>
Obviously the original app can be improved in many ways. Just for the heck of it I added two mapview screens - **Bulky waste** and **'Szops'** - problem waste. JSON files were scrapped of the website.

## Overlays üó∫ ~2018 (iOS)

Slightly modified (for educational purposes) raywenderlich.com's "MapKit Tutorial: Overlay Views" (The first part) <br>
You can load custom overlay image and corresponding JSON file generated by Maptiler app. <br>
I added user's position tracking and slider to change opacity of the overlay. <br>

## LottoScanner üçÄ

- UI: SwiftUI
- iOS: 14.5
- Persistence: JSON + serialization in internal storage
- OCR: Google ML Kit's TextRecognizer, BarcodeRecognizer

My attempt to create a prototype of the anticipated iOS Lotto coupon scanner / winnings calculator. 
- Fetches latest lottery drawings results from [Mobilotto](http://serwis.mobilotto.pl/mapi_v6/index.php?json=getGames)
- Allows user to fix misrecognized numbers (Accuracy is pretty high though)

Early version. Currently recognizes Lotto coupon (Lotto, Plus and Super Szansa games).

### Status
Needs massive refactoring. Utilize Core Data, Apple's Vision, ...
